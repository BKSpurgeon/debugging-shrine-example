# Small self-contained examples

### 1. Clone the repository and install the gems

* `git clone git@github.com:BKSpurgeon/debugging-shrine-example.git`

* Then run 'bundle install'

### 2. Write your tests - either in the sequel or active record templates

We've used minitest - but you can easily substitute it for your own.

### 3. Run the test

* `bundle exec ruby active_record_template.rb`

### 4. Deubbing Shrine Locally

* If you want to debug shrine locally, clone the shrine repository and go to your Gemfile and set the path to the shrine repository to the directory in your computer.
* Don't forget to run `bundle install`.

### 5. Paste the script to a github issue
